Hi everyone!

This is Graphical User Interface (GUI) application using WindowsForms C#. The bank register initialize and ask the user to input the account holder name, account number and initial balance.
For this application I created a Customer class with the fields first name, last name, account number, account balance and the methods. 

# bankingRegister
